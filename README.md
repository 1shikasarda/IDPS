# *IDPS(Intrusion Detection and Prevention System)*
## *Overview*
The Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) is a critical cybersecurity solution designed to monitor, detect, and block malicious activities in real time. It safeguards networks and systems by analyzing traffic, identifying threats, and automatically preventing attacks before they cause harm.

## *Key Features*
✔ Real-Time Threat Detection – Continuously scans network traffic, system logs, and user activities for suspicious behavior.
✔ Malicious URL Blocking – Automatically detects and blocks unsafe links using threat intelligence databases and heuristic analysis.
✔ Signature & Anomaly-Based Detection – Identifies known attack patterns (signatures) and unusual behavior (anomalies).
✔ Automated Prevention – Instantly stops attacks such as malware, phishing, DDoS, and unauthorized access attempts.
✔ User Alerts & Blacklist Management – Notifies users of blocked threats and allows administrators to manually manage blacklisted URLs/IPs.
✔ Logging & Reporting – Maintains detailed records of security events for compliance and forensic analysis.

## *Use Cases*
Enterprise Security – Protects corporate networks from intrusions and data breaches.

Web Application Protection – Blocks malicious requests targeting web servers.

Endpoint Security – Prevents malware infections via unsafe links and downloads.

Compliance & Auditing – Helps meet regulatory requirements with attack logs and reports.

By combining detection, prevention, and user awareness, the IDPS enhances security posture while minimizing manual intervention.
